            <p class="card-text"> Beginner 15-second rest between each exercise<br>
                Intermediate 5-second rest between each exercise<br>
                Advanced no rests until end of the set<br>
                <br>
                Set 1:<br>
                10x regular pushup<br>
                10x diamond pushup - bring your hands close together to form a diamond or triangle shape below your chest. <br>
                10x Elevated single-arm push-up (right)- Start with one arm straight out to the side, elevated on a chair or something similar. Get through the reps with as little assistance from your elevated arm as you can manage.<br>
                10x Elevated single-arm push-up (left)<br>
                10x Pike Push-Up - Begin in a downward dog yoga position, with your feet and hands just wider than shoulder width. Keep your hips high, heels low, and maintain the inverted-V position as you bend your elbows and lower your head toward the floor between your hands. Reverse the movement to the starting position for one repetition.<br>
                <br>
                Set 2: <br>
                10x Wide pushup - regular pushup but with your hands farther out to each side<br>
                10x Staggered Hands Push-Up - From a standard push-up position, move one hand forward and the other backward so they’re offset by about six to 12 inches<br>
                10x Clap Push-Ups - From a standard push-up position, lower your chest until it’s slightly below the level of your bent elbow, and then push upward with enough force so that your hands leave the ground by a few inches. Try to clap while your hands are off the ground. Land with soft elbows in push-up form and continue the lowering motion toward the ground. Repeat.<br> 
                10x regular pushup<br>
                1-2 min plank<br>
                <br>
                Make it easier:
                <ul>
                    <li>Knees: Perform push-ups on your knees instead of your feet</li>
                    <li>Incline: Elevate your hands on a bench, chair, or table—the higher above your feet, the easier.</li>
                </ul>
                Make it harder: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feet Stacked: Cross one ankle over the other so only one foot is on the ground. This requires more core activation for stability.</li>
                    <li>Decline: Elevate your feet on a box, bench, or step to increase the activation of the upper chest muscles and the front of the shoulders (anterior deltoids). The higher your feet, the more difficult.</li>
                    <li>Weighted: Wear a weight vest or have a friend place a weight plate on your back for an added strength challenge.</li>
                </ul>
